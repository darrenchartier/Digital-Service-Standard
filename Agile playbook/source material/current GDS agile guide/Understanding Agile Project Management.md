# Understanding agile project management

## **Agile and government services: an introduction**

You must use the agile approach to project management to build and run government digital services.

Agile methods encourage teams to build quickly, test what they’ve built and iterate their work based on regular feedback.

### **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-4) in your service assessments, you must show how your team is using agile methods to build and run your service.

### **Where agile comes from**

[Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) started out as an alternative approach to software development, but is now applied more widely to running other types of projects and products.

The principles behind agile are set out in the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) (2001).

### **The differences between traditional and agile methods**

Agile can be very different for people used to traditional [waterfall methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) for software development.

With waterfall methods the process is sequential. You start by gathering requirements, making plans and going through procurement processes. You then design the product and build it. In the final stage you test and release it to the public. It’s only at this end stage that you get feedback and find out if it works for your users. You only have one chance to get each part of the project right, because you don’t return to earlier stages.

Agile takes a different approach. You do all these things - gathering requirements, planning, designing, building and testing - at the same time. You start small in the discovery and alpha phases.

You research, prototype, test and learn about your users’ needs before you start building the real service in the beta phase.

You only go live when you have enough feedback to show your service works for your users and meets their needs. You continuously learn and improve to build a service that meets user needs.

### **Why agile is better for services**

While a sequential waterfall approach is necessary to build things like bridges and buildings, it’s less effective for building and running services when technology changes quickly.

Government services also need to be able to respond quickly to policy changes and the needs of the public.

Using waterfall methods means you may spend 18 months building a service that no longer meets government policy, can’t work with the latest technology and doesn’t meet users’ needs.

Agile methods allow you to quickly make any changes while you’re building the service, and also when it’s live on GOV.UK.

For example, since January 2013 visits to GOV.UK from mobiles doubled from 15% to 30%, which means any services not built to adapt to mobile will need to change quickly to meet users’ needs.

### **Case studies and examples**

The following examples show how different teams across government have successfully adopted an agile approach:

* [The Public Guardian on agile development](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/26/the-public-guardian-on-agile-development) - the Public Guardian on using agile methods to build the Lasting Power of Attorney service

* [Working together to help people with court fees](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/23/working-together-to-help-people-with-court-fees) - Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service on how an agile approach helped redesign how people get help with court fees

## **Agile methods: an introduction**

There are many agile methods you can use when building your service, each has its own set of tools and techniques.

This guide introduces the 3 most popular agile methods:

* Scrum

* Kanban

* Lean

### **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass point 4 (use agile methods) in your service assessments, you must show how your team is using agile methods to build and run your service.

### **Popular agile methods explained**

#### **Scrum**

Scrum is the most commonly used agile method.

It allows a highly structured model with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This can be particularly useful for traditionally structured organisations that are moving to agile.

Learn more about the features of Scrum in the [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), written by the developers of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

#### **Kanban**

Kanban as a development method was inspired by production systems that focus on reducing waste and improving quality, like those created by Toyota.

Kanban is a way of visualising and improving your current working practices so that work flows through a system quickly.

A fast and smooth flow of work means you can:

* deliver value quickly and predictably

* get early feedback to find out whether your product or service is meeting user needs

Read the following to learn more about Kanban:

* [A brief introduction to Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/)

* [The Principles of the Kanban Method](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0)

#### **Lean**

Lean software development, like Kanban, is adapted from lean manufacturing principles like the Toyota Production System.

The principles of Lean aim to help your team focus on:

* reducing waste

* delivering quickly

* learning and improving

* using evidence and data to make decisions

Read the following to learn more about Lean:

* [The Lean Mindset](http://www.poppendieck.com/)

* [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/)

### **Working with multiple agile methods**

You don’t have to work with just one method, you can choose tools and techniques from several to meet your team’s needs.

Each method has its own language for describing basic tools and techniques, the important thing is to understand:

* why you’ve chosen a tool or technique

* its agile objective

[Find other agile methods you can use.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_methods)

### **Deciding which methods to work with**

#### **Scrum**

Scrum is a good starting point if your team is new to agile working.

Your team will generally find Scrum most useful when you’re:

* building a new product or service

* enhancing existing features

* adding new features in each ‘sprint’ (a fixed period of time)

When you’re running your live service and have urgent requests you may find sprints constraining and want to move to a flow-based method like Kanban.

But you can still keep using many of the activities associated with Scrum, like daily standup meetings, retrospectives and regular reviews of progress.

#### **Kanban**

Kanban helps your team to:

* find the bottlenecks in your processes

* control the amount of work you’re doing

* predict your output based on actual delivery

It’s particularly useful at times when your team needs to react quickly to changing priorities.

#### **Lean**

Lean allows your team to focus on learning as quickly as possible.

Lean’s tools and techniques are particularly useful when your team is first discovering what your users’ needs are and deciding how to address those needs.

## **Core principles of agile**

You must build and run your service using agile methods.

There are different agile methods you can use, but you should always follow these core principles:

* focus on user needs

* deliver iteratively

* keep improving how your team works

* fail fast and learn quickly

* keep planning

### **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass point 4 (use agile methods) in your service assessments, you must show how you’re using agile methods to build and run services.

### **Focus on user needs**

Agile is about constantly putting your users first. You must prioritise their needs over everyone else’s, including those of your senior stakeholders.

#### **Why user needs matter**

If you start building your service before you understand who your users are and what they need the service to do, you risk:

* building something that nobody needs or wants

* trying to solve problems that aren’t important to users

You need to ask for your users’ feedback early and often, and listen to them - even when they tell you things you disagree with or don’t want to hear.

You should always use data from real people who are using your service and let it influence the direction of your project.

### **Keep improving your service**

To work in an agile way, you must continuously improve your service and its features - this is sometimes called ‘iterating’.

Every service is different, and building a service is a process which involves a lot of decisions made over time but, in general, follow these steps:

1. Build something that meets the need that’s most important to your users.

2. Show it to your users, listen to their feedback and improve it.

3. Repeat this process to meet the next most important user need.

Agile is about making the complex process of building a digital service as simple as possible. It’s based on improving what you do day by day and week by week.

#### **Why you need to keep improving your service**

The process of producing incremental, production-ready features allows you to:

* give value to your users and stakeholders regularly

* shorten feedback loops that could be longer if using a waterfall methodology (where you only seek feedback when the final product is complete)

* decide the features you want to add next

* spend time creating features that your users care about

### **Keep improving how your team works**

As well as improving your service gradually by talking to your users, talk to your team to keep improving the way they work, so that:

* the team learns and improves throughout the life of your service

* the quality of your service improves, saving you save time, effort and money

#### **Find out what’s not working**

Talk to your team to find out what’s working and what needs to be improved, for example in your team’s daily standup or regular retro.

You should try to discover:

* any problems the team is having with absolutely any part of the work

* anything that’s stopping the team getting work done or delaying work

* any problems individual people have

#### **Fix the problems**

Once you’ve found problems, you should agree on a way to fix them.

Use standups and retros to see if what you did fixed problems the team talked about at previous meetings.

Find out more about standups and retros.

### **Fail fast, learn quickly**

Agile techniques don’t guarantee success, but you don’t have to be afraid to fail or experiment, as agile allows you to spot problems early and resolve them quickly. You should learn to fail and create a culture that learns from failure.

You can prevent major issues or failures from happening by:

* demonstrating value to your senior stakeholders (eg the senior responsible officer, director or deputy director) with regular releases

* releasing regularly to prevent creating a ‘too-big-to-fail’ service that shouldn’t be released, but must be released anyway

* using processes like test-driven development and automated testing (writing tests before you develop the features to be tested) to highlight issues with quality early on

* identifying important metrics, establishing a baseline and monitoring for changes throughout the project

#### **Release regularly**

Regularly releasing and testing small features with your users:

* improves quality

* improves visibility

* reduces cost

### **Keep planning**

In an agile project, you should continuously plan based on data and usage patterns from the service you’re trying to replace.

Your team should plan together and review these plans regularly based on:

* your progress

* any new facts and requirements
