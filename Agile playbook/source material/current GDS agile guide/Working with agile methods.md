Things move quickly in agile, so digital teams need easy ways to coordinate their activities, communicate progress and collaborate.

You should design your physical working environment and choose suitable technology to encourage agile ways of working.

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

Creating an agile working environment is one of a number of approaches that will help you pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment).

## **What an agile environment looks like**

You should expect to see lots of short meetings throughout each day, often around walls covered in notes or reference material. This may seem strange in office cultures that are more used to formal meetings or conference calls.

Those working in creative and technical fields often need plenty of space for focused, detailed work. It’s common to see people spend most of the day with headphones on to help them focus, or deep in conversation with just one person with whom they’re pairing.

## **Decide what you need from your environment**

Working spaces for digital projects will vary. At the beginning of a project, decide with your team:

* how to structure your space

* the tools you need

## **Your physical environment**

The space a team works in is a tool. It’s just as important as the choice of programming language or project management tools.

### **Sitting together**

Ideally, your team will work from the same location and sit together.

Short, informal conversations are an important way to test assumptions. These are much harder when a team is spread across an office or in different buildings.

### **Hacking the environment**

Removing dividers between desks makes a big difference and allows conversation between the team to flow more freely. If large monitors are getting in the way, remove them.

You might also want to think about getting a desk organiser.

This process is known as ‘hacking the environment’.

### **Wall space**

Teams using agile approaches need wall space in their work area. If you can’t use a wall, you could try whiteboards or windows.

You need sticky notes or cards and blu-tack to post records of your work on the walls.

The wall creates a physical focus for the team so they can:

* gather round it at their daily standup

* refer to and update it during the day

* show the status of their work to anyone outside of the team

This helps the team to:

* discuss what they’re working on

* sort out problems

* talk through ideas

This is called ‘visual management’.

Find out [how to set up your team wall](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/team-wall).

## **The right technology**

As a team, you also need online tools to help you communicate and manage your work.

Individual members of the team may also need access to tools to help them with their role (for example, your user researcher may need access to video editing software).

You should check if anyone needs training to use the tools you choose.

### **Online communication**

Meetings like standups or retrospectives help people to keep in touch but you also need a tool for online discussions.

An online tool helps the team to stay in contact and means you can:

* make quick decisions

* provide support and information

* keep everyone informed about the work you’re doing

The Government Digital Service (GDS) uses [Slack](https://slack.com/), the Environment Agency uses [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) uses [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/).

These tools work like chatrooms and allow your team to talk in a more conversational way than they would with emails.

They stop large backlogs of emails building up for people who are out of the office and allow the team to communicate even if they’re not in the same room.

### **Collaboration**

You must have a browser-based editing tool so your team can work on the same documents at the same time.

This is a mandatory [open standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/sharing-or-collaborating-with-government-documents) requirement for government.

It also helps you avoid having multiple versions of the same document. GDS, MoJ and many other departments use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).

GDS and MoJ also use collaboration tools like [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) for internal wikis, while GDS uses [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) for cross-government communities.

### **Managing your backlog**

You might find an online board helps you to manage your backlog, in addition to your physical wall.

Online boards allow you to record further detail behind backlog items (like draft designs) and to link to discussions on collaboration tools.

Teams at GDS use Trello, which is also used for the publicly available [GOV.UK roadmap.](https://trello.com/b/GyqsETvS/gov-uk-high-level-roadmap) HMRC, Home Office and MoJ use JIRA.

For more information about finding the right technology for your needs, see: [Internet tools for civil servants guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-skills-in-the-civil-service/internet-tools-for-civil-servants-an-introduction).

## **Visit agile working environments**

If you’re setting up an agile working environment for your team, you might find it useful to go and look at how other agile teams are working.

Get in touch with the [agile delivery community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery-community) to arrange a tour.

## **Related guides**

You may also find the following guides useful:

* [Team wall](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/team-wall)

* [Agile tools and techniques](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques)

Using agile tools and techniques can help your digital service team to:

* self-organise and plan

* communicate (within the team and with the rest of your organisation)

* continuously improve the way you work

* get support from senior responsible officers (SROs) and service managers

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment), you must show how your team is using agile tools and techniques to build and run your service.

## **Introducing agile tools and techniques**

This guide describes some of the most common agile tools and techniques that service teams use. You can use others if your team decides they’ll be useful.

You might also hear these called ‘agile ceremonies and artefacts’.

## **Daily standup**

The standup is a daily meeting for the team to discuss what they’re working on and whether there are any problems or dependencies they need to resolve (for example, needing help from someone else).

Standups should last no longer than 15 minutes. You should hold them at the same time every day. It’s best if you do it standing up in front of your [team wall](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/team-wall).

## **Sprint planning meetings**

Sprint planning meetings are a feature of [Scrum](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-methodologies). You should hold them at the start of each [sprint.](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint)

At a sprint planning meeting, the team decides what to work on next and how they’ll do it.

The length of the meeting will depend on how long your sprint is.

See: [sprint planning](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning) by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the creators of Scrum

## **Retrospective meetings**

Retrospectives, sometimes called ‘retros’, are regular meetings where your whole team talks about what’s going well and what isn’t.

Teams usually hold retros at the end of an iteration (for example a sprint) and use them to talk about the work from that period of time.

The point of a retro is to fix any problems in the team and to make sure you keep doing the things that are working.

### **How to run a retro**

One person should host the retro and decide on questions for the team to talk about.

If you’re hosting, pick broad questions that allow the team to set the agenda, rather than strictly setting it yourself.

Retros should have an open atmosphere where every member of the team can speak honestly and feel confident that their colleagues will listen.

Allow 60 to 90 minutes for the meeting and use a private space where you can stick post-it notes to the wall.

A basic retro could follow these steps:

1. The host explains the questions at the beginning and sticks a post-it note to the wall for each question.

2. Each team member writes down one or more answers for each question on post-it notes and sticks them to the right part of the wall.

3. The group discusses issues as they come up, or at the end.

4. The host decides on actions to fix any problems raised, and assigns them to members of the team.

You could choose to cover 3 or 4 of the following topics:

* what went well in the last iteration

* what went badly in the last iteration

* what’s puzzling the team or what the team doesn’t understand

* who the team wants to thank (eg other members of the team)

These topics are just examples, there are many different types of retro. You can [find more in the Retrospective wiki](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Agile_Retrospective_Resource_Wiki).

If you’re hosting the retro, you should pick topics which you think will prompt useful discussions in your team, for example on transparency, team learning or your working process.

### **Make a list of actions**

You should use the information you get from your retro to improve your work and your working environment.

Make a list of actions that you’ll carry out to fix the problems that your team highlighted and assign them to people in the team.

You should aim to get the actions done before the next retro.

## **Team review (show and tell)**

The team review is a regular meeting which gives team members the opportunity to demonstrate their work. It can also be called a sprint review or a show and tell.

You can invite stakeholders like directors or suppliers to this meeting and use it to tell them about the user stories you’ve completed or other work you’ve done.

You’ll need a screen to show your work and enough space for people to join in.

If your service is part of a larger organisation or programme you may want to open up your review to the rest of the organisation every few weeks.

This gives you the opportunity to show the most important work you’ve done, talk about what you’ve learned, explain your plans for the next few weeks and answer questions. It also gives other teams the chance to see how your work relates to theirs.

See: [how a Ministry of Justice team got stakeholders involved in sprint reviews](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/28/getting-stakeholders-more-involved-in-sprint-reviews/)

## **User stories**

User stories are a way for your team to briefly record the things you need to do to build the service. You can use them to prompt discussions about features when you’re ready to start work on them.

See: [writing user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories)

## **The backlog**

Your team will have a product backlog where you’ll store the user stories you haven’t started work on yet in order of priority. If you’re following Scrum methodology you’ll also have a [sprint backlog](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-sprintbacklog) to store the stories the team has agreed to work on in that sprint.

See:

* [Creating an agile working environment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/create-agile-working-environment) for more information about tools that can help you manage your backlog

* [product backlog](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog) by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the creators of Scrum

## **Team walls**

Your team wall is a wall near where you sit on which you keep a visual record of your work.

The wall shows what your team has done, what they’re currently doing and the work still to do.

It helps your team to collaborate and allows other people in the organisation to see what you’re doing.

See:

* [Set up a team wall](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/team-wall)

* [Creating an agile working environment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/create-agile-working-environment)

To help your service team to work in an agile way, you may want to set up a team wall.

In agile working, team walls are a section of wall near where your team sits on which you keep a visual record of the work you’re doing.

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

You must show you’re working in an agile way to pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment).

Using walls to communicate and manage your work is one part of working in an agile way.

## **How team walls work**

You record individual pieces of work on a card or piece of paper and stick them to the wall.

You stick other cards on the wall which represent stages of production, you can then move the pieces of work along the wall as they pass through the production stages.

## **What to put on your team wall**

Most teams fill the wall with paper or post-it notes and various headings, to show everything the team is working on, the stage of production it’s at, and any work that’s upcoming.

Your wall will differ depending on the service you’re building, but most teams include details of:

* work the team is currently doing

* work the team hasn’t started yet

* work that’s done

You should also use the wall to track:

* progress against your goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) – for live data, you could show this on an electronic dashboard like the [Government Digital Service performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance)

* any risks and issues you’ve found

* major obstacles to delivery, things which are stopping you getting work done (these are sometimes called ‘blockers’)

* important deadlines and dependencies

You can also display information about your service and your team, for example:

* your service vision

* photos or profiles of the people who are on your team

* your working arrangements, eg when you have retrospectives or other meetings

## **How team walls help**

Team walls help you to:

* map out problems you’re exploring

* manage work you’ve agreed to do

* share a lot of information quickly and publicly

* put all your work together and see how it’s progressing

* start conversations in your team or with others in your office, eg about your processes or points where work gets blocked

* encourage communication and collaboration in your team, and with the rest of the organisation

An up-to-date wall also allows you to:

* have a physical focal point for the team to look at and comment on during standups and other meetings

* promote transparency and discussion by showing everyone in your organisation the status of your work

* make decisions based on an overview of your work

* manage and measure workflow and spot problems that are delaying you

Example:

A team mapped out the current processes for importing and exporting goods across the UK border, which are currently handled by 26 different government departments and agencies.

[Read about what they learned from mapping the processes in their discovery](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/07/mapping-the-border-as-users-see-it/).

### **Online tools**

As well as your team wall, you may want to record the work your team is doing online, for example using a tool like [Trello.](http://www.trello.com/)

If you do this you should always post information about current and future work to your wall.

If possible you can display your online tool on a screen in your work area so it is still visible to everyone.

User stories describe a user and the reason why they need to use the service you’re building.

You must use user stories when building your service - they’re essential to building and running a service that meets user needs.

You should make sure every member of your team writes user stories and uses them to:

* track everything they need to do

* think about their work from a user’s perspective

* discuss their work with colleagues

* prioritise their work

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 1 (understand user needs)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/understand-user-needs) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment), you need to show how you’re using user stories to understand user needs for your service.

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods) you need to show how you’ve adopted agile tools and techniques, including working with user stories.

To pass [point 5 (iterate and improve frequently)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/iterate-and-improve-frequently) you need to show how you prioritise user stories and move them quickly and smoothly from research to production.

## **How to write a user story**

### **What to include**

Your user stories should include enough information for your product manager to decide how important the story is. They should always include:

* the person using the service (the actor)

* what the user needs the service for (the narrative)

* why the user needs it (the goal)

### **The right format for user stories**

They’re usually written in the format:

As a… [who is the user?]

I need/want/expect to… [what does the user want to do?]

So that… [why does the user want to do this?]

Example:

The [Register to vote service’s](https://www.gov.uk/info/register-to-vote) user story is ‘as a UK resident, I want to get my details on the electoral register so that I can vote’.

You don’t have to use this format but you should always briefly explain the actor, the narrative and the goal.

### **Focus on the goal**

The most important part of a user story is the goal. This helps you:

* make sure you’re solving the right problem

* decide when the story is done and a user need is met

If you’re struggling to write the goal then you should reconsider why you think you need that feature.

### **Acceptance criteria**

You can also include a few acceptance criteria for each story. Acceptance criteria are a list of outcomes that you use as a checklist to confirm that your service has done its job and is meeting that user need.

They’re often written as a list that begins with ‘it’s done when…’.

Example:

The acceptance criteria for the Register to vote service are the following:

* ‘it’s done when the user knows how to register online’

* ‘it’s done when the user knows how to download a form to register by post’

* ‘it’s done when the user knows where to send the form’

Use the acceptance criteria to link to any evidence (for example spreadsheets or diagrams) that support the story.

## **Epics**

Large user stories (ones that would take more than a few weeks to develop and test) are typically called epics. If possible, split a large story or epic into smaller stories that can be completed within [an iteration.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)

## **How to record user stories**

Record each user story on a card and give it a title. The cards can be:

* actual cards posted on your team wall

* digital, eg teams at the Ministry of Justice and the Government Digital Service use [Trello](https://www.trello.com/) and [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/)

### **Planning with your user stories**

When you have a lot of stories, you might want to keep them in a digital format (like Trello or a spreadsheet) and then turn them into physical cards as part of planning.

You should put all your stories in your backlog where your product manager will organise them in order of priority. They will then sit in the backlog until your team decides they are ready to work on them.

Your product manager and relevant team members can have a more in-depth discussion about the story when they’re ready to start work on it. You should record more detail from these discussions in the user story.

Planning is vital to the success of agile working. Planning allows everyone to understand:

* what your vision and objectives are

* what you need to do to achieve your objectives

* how you know when you’ve achieved them

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment), you must show that you plan in an agile way.

## **Differences between agile and waterfall planning**

In waterfall projects you typically do detailed planning early on in a project, before the development stage.

After planning it’s rare that you go back and make changes.

You hold plans in requirement documents and Gantt charts that may not be accessible to everyone.

In agile, you change your plans as you do more work and learn more about your users.

You should focus your efforts on planning at the right level at the right time. Plan work you don’t expect to do for a while at a high level. Make a more detailed plan for work you are just about to do.

In agile, you should make your planning visible to the rest of your organisation.

Use your [team wall](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/team-wall) to display your vision, goals, roadmap and [user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories).

You should also allow anyone in your organisation to see any planning you do using online tools.

## **How to make an agile plan**

Follow these 3 steps to make an agile plan.

1. Decide on a vision.

2. Make objectives.

3. Make a roadmap.

### **Decide on a vision**

Every product or service benefits from a vision - a simple statement explaining what you’re trying to achieve.

It’s important that people working on your service and its stakeholders understand the vision and are involved in writing it. This creates a collective sense of ownership.

### **Make objectives**

You should define some objectives that you want to achieve and have a system for checking when you’ve achieved these objectives.

One way you can do this is by tracking results you can measure for each objective. For example:

1. Start by defining 3 to 5 main objectives.

2. For each objective, define 3 to 4 results you can measure using quantitative data.

You should also:

* set your objectives a year in advance, although you can change them

* change how you’re measuring results as you learn more about the service

### **Make a roadmap**

You should make and keep a roadmap of the main features you need to build to achieve your objectives. Your team must have the authority to develop and own the roadmap.

Your roadmap should typically set out your plans 6 to 12 months in advance. If you have fixed deadlines, for example ministerial deadlines, you should focus your roadmap planning around what you can achieve within that deadline.

Revisit your roadmap regularly to re-prioritise what you’ll be working on in the near future. In large programmes of work with many dependencies, you may want to look at your roadmap weekly.

Make your roadmap visible by displaying it on your team wall or board.

If you have more than one team or organisation working towards a common goal, you should put the roadmaps for separate streams of work together on a wall.

This allows you to see cross-team or cross-organisation dependencies, including what any external third parties are doing.

## **Hold planning meetings**

You should hold a meeting with your whole team to make detailed plans of the work you’ll be carrying out in the next iteration or sprint.

Use this meeting to:

* make sure that the whole team understands the work they’re about to do

* talk about possible approaches, issues and dependencies based on [user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories) from your backlog

* keep up collaboration between the different disciplines in your team

* include members of other teams or external teams if there are cross-team or cross-organisation dependencies

## **Further reading**

Read a GOV.UK Verify blog post about [making clear goals for complex agile programmes](https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/11/goals-cycles-and-people-running-an-agile-complex-programme-in-government/).

There’s always a long list of things you could work on when developing a product or service. But you’ll usually have a limited amount of time, materials or skills available.

Prioritising what you should work on and in what order is an important part of delivering good products and services.

Decisions about what to prioritise should be made regularly - for example, weekly to prioritise the sprint backlog, or quarterly to organise the service [roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap).

The person leading the exercise should use a clear prioritisation method and involve the delivery team and stakeholders.

## **Prioritisation methods**

There are lots of [prioritisation methods](https://foldingburritos.com/product-prioritization-techniques/). Choosing the right method will depend on the capacity of your team and what stage your product or service is at in the delivery lifecycle.

You’ll probably need to try out a few methods before deciding which one best suits the needs of the thing you’re working on.

[MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) is a widely used method, often chosen for its simplicity. It helps you break down your backlog and roadmap into:

* ‘must haves’ - essential things that your product can’t function without

* ‘should haves’ - things that can greatly improve the product, but aren’t crucial to making it function

* ‘could haves’ - things that can improve the service, but won’t have too negative an impact if left out at this stage

* ‘won’t haves’ - low priority things that the team has agreed not to do

Ranking tasks in this way helps you decide what to work on first and what not to include in the backlog if you only have the time and skills to do a certain number of tasks.

MoSCoW and other prioritisation techniques provide a way to work out and present prioritisation. They need to be informed by performance analysis, user research and input from stakeholders. Using this information helps you work out what the needs are, how they relate to one another and how you might work through them.

## **Prioritising tasks during the different development phases**

What you consider high priority should change as your service develops.

For example, during the [beta phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) you’ll be able to prioritise improvements as you test and iterate the service.

During the [live phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works), users will be using your service so you’ll need to prioritise support work alongside continuous improvements.

## **Involve the team in decisions**

Your team needs to understand how prioritisation decisions are made and be able to challenge them. They will have thought of things you haven’t. Using a clear method that your team understands will help them do this.

Involve your team in discussing how to iterate on the method you are using or deciding to change to another method. Give yourself and your team sufficient time to use and learn each prioritisation method - consistency is important.

A roadmap is a plan that shows how a product or service is likely to develop over time.

Roadmaps need to be easy to understand, and simple to adjust when priorities change - as often happens with agile ways of working.

## **Why roadmaps are important**

A roadmap makes it clear what you’re trying to achieve and the steps you’ll take towards that end goal. This applies whether you’re working on a whole service or a product that supports a service.

As well as making it clear what you’re doing, a roadmap also explains what you’re not doing.

A roadmap helps the wider team understand how what they’re working on now relates to future work and priorities.

Anyone involved in providing a budget or governance for your work needs to see a roadmap so they understand when and how your team is likely to deliver value to users.

Having an open roadmap also makes it clear to other delivery teams what you’re working on, so everyone can see where things might overlap and you can avoid duplicating work. When things are open, it’s easier to find and share useful code, patterns and supporting materials across products.

Users of your product or service may want to find out what your plans are for developing it, as might people who deliver public services or hold government to account.

## **Roadmap principles**

### **1. Your roadmap takes you towards a vision, in iterations**

Your product or service should have a long-term vision that explains what it’s ultimately trying to achieve for users. Your roadmap should be broken down into the stages, or product iterations, that will get you there. At GDS each product iteration is known as a ‘mission’.

### **2. A roadmap shows what you’re trying to achieve**

Products and services should be judged by the value they deliver to users. Examples of value are making things quicker, making things simpler and saving people effort.

Roadmaps are a tool to express what the value of a product will be. They show the stages in which that value will be understood and released to users.

### **3. Each service or product should have a roadmap**

A product can have its own roadmap or it can be part of a wider roadmap that gives a collective view of products related to a service.

It’s best to keep your roadmap online using a spreadsheet or other software, to minimise the risk of losing any information.

If the needs of your users or team mean you need more than one version of your roadmap, like one on a wall and one online, use one as your master version but make sure each version is always up to date with the latest information.

### **4. Roadmaps are developed iteratively and regularly**

Creating and iterating a roadmap is something you do collaboratively, usually led by your product manager. [The delivery team and stakeholders should all be involved](http://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap), and you must also use things you’ve learnt from [performance analysis](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success) and [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research) to inform the decisions you make. At GDS roadmaps are iterated on at least a quarterly basis.

### **5. A roadmap should be open**

It should be available for other civil servants to view and should where possible be in the public domain. The main exceptions are when there’s a very good security reason not to make a roadmap available, or if there are political sensitivities around sharing plans.

### **6. It needs to be easy to understand**

A roadmap should use simple visuals to make it easy and quick to understand. It should also be in [plain English](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#plain-english) and free of jargon so it’s accessible and usable for the range of people who will use it. It can contain links to places where users can find more information, like a backlog or blog.

### **7. Product iterations have clear objectives**

Each product iteration in your roadmap should have an objective that gets you closer to achieving your long-term vision. There should be a clear goal each time (often a problem to be solved) and an explanation of how you’ll measure progress.

Roadmaps are not the same as [backlogs](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog), which are used by teams to manage the delivery of features and tasks in smaller, time-boxed periods.

### **8. Missions and phases have fixed time periods**

Missions are mapped over time - this might be done in quarters. These segments of time need to be consistent.

When the roadmap includes [phases](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery#phases-of-an-agile-project) (like discovery or beta) these should be timeboxed.

### **9. Roadmaps are clear about priority**

A good roadmap shows what’s been done and what’s coming next in order of priority. [The way you prioritise](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/deciding-on-priorities) needs to be consistent and transparent.

### **10. Roadmaps capture intent and allow for change**

Roadmaps allow you to plan for change. They capture intent, not solutions.

The further into the future a mission will take place, the more uncertain it is. The closer it gets, the more you learn and the more confident you become about whether it’s the right thing to work on.

Things can be added to or dropped from roadmaps.

### **11. They explain the ‘who’ and the ‘how’**

A roadmap should have an explanation of who it’s for and how to read it.

It should also include information about who maintains the roadmap, how often it’s updated and how to contribute to developing it.

### **12. They’re reusable**

When you use software to create a roadmap, the content should be exportable so it can be transferred if needed.
