# **Governance principles for agile service delivery**

The following 6 principles will help you create an agile culture for your service team and organisation:

1. Don’t slow down delivery

2. Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level

3. Do it with the right people

4. Go see for yourself

5. Only do it if it adds value

6. Trust and verify

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-4) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment), you must show how you’re using agile methods to build and run your service.

## **Who is involved in governance**

Everyone in the delivery team is responsible for and involved in its governance. [Agile tools and techniques](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques) (daily stand-ups, regular planning meetings and retrospectives) are all ways of governing delivery.

Delivery teams also need help from people who are responsible for supporting an agile team through management and governance activity. These generally are:

* service owners

* delivery managers

* senior responsible officers (SROs)

* auditors and assurers

* digital leaders, chief technology officers and other senior civil servants

## **Don’t slow down delivery**

Your service team must build a service that you continually improve to meet user needs. As service owner, you should:

* find a way to get work done when it’s ‘blocked’ and slowing down delivery, especially if your team doesn’t have the authority to do so

* be available and make frequent decisions throughout service delivery

* be mindful of the balance between releasing new features and maintaining quality

* protect the team from, or help them handle, external pressures

You should keep a good pace of delivery by:

* having short, frequent meetings, like standups

* managing risks and issues that will affect the delivery of your service as and when needed

* basing controls (eg on spending) on the balance between costs and benefits

Transition between the phases of service delivery should be seamless, so people who govern must anticipate problems and make timely decisions to allow this.

## **Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level**

Iterative development is the best way of handling change and improving service quality. Embrace that things change and decisions need to be made frequently. Make sure:

* decision making is evidence-based and focused on meeting user needs

* the service owner and team have the authority to make decisions and only escalate when they need to

* you handle change and improve quality through continuous iterative development

You should also ensure that service teams know:

* that they have the authority to make decisions about the service

* what the boundaries of that decision making are

* who is accountable for helping them when decisions outside the boundaries need to be made

### **Risk management**

Risks can’t be eliminated and you should highlight and own only the ones that could affect service delivery.

In agile, you need to deal with risks at the right time. Identify the best possible moment to respond to important risks and only then start to plan and carry out your response.

## **Do it with the right people**

As a service owner or SRO you should:

* make sure the people in your team have all the skills they need

* give them the environment, workspace and tools to collaborate, organise and deliver

* have a flat organisation structure so everyone in your team can contribute to the team’s success

You should make sure that everyone involved in redesigning or creating your government service is:

* capable, motivated and empowered

* focused on goals and outcomes including [key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/using-data-to-improve-your-service-an-introduction#what-to-measure)

* open and honest about what they do

Find out how to [set up a service team for each phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/set-up-a-service-team).

## **Go see for yourself**

It’s everyone’s responsibility to stay well informed. Delivery teams talk face to face wherever possible and the best way to measure progress is to ‘see the thing’.

SROs should visit teams regularly and take part in a [delivery team’s meetings](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques), particularly sprint reviews or show and tells. This makes sure they’re fully informed and can make decisions quickly.

If these meetings aren’t happening, find out why.

### **Reporting and planning**

Going to see for yourself, and looking at data that delivery teams are already using to manage delivery, should give you the information you need to govern.

Walls are an excellent way to track work and show important things, like what the team is doing and how they’re progressing. It helps planning and communication within the team and to other teams.

Read more in the guide [Measuring and reporting progress](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/measuring-reporting-progress).

## **Only do it if it adds value**

In agile delivery management there’s a focus on giving value to users early and continuously. This means your team needs to:

* have a service vision and goals based on user needs

* set out measures of success and communicate these regularly

* value quality and make sure that user needs are met (give the team time to do this)

* explore and develop ideas that could add value - if they don’t work, try something else

To do this the service delivery team should develop a charter (written document, posters etc) that describes:

* their service vision

* quantifiable goals

* key performance indicators (KPIs) that show progress against meeting user needs and organisational goals

## **Trust and verify**

Governance should be simple and supportive. It should trust individuals and give decision-making authority to teams so they can focus on delivering.

People who govern should regularly speak to the team to help support, steer and assure. To monitor progress use a light touch. This means checking services a little, but often.

Regular reflection on how teams are doing and finding ways to improve is an important part of good governance. At the end of each iteration every delivery team holds a retrospective where it discusses lessons learned - both what went well and what didn’t. This lets you identify actions which are then planned into future iterations. Retrospectives should also be used across programmes of work.

# **Measuring and reporting progress**

Good reporting helps senior responsible officers (SROs) and service managers make decisions and give feedback when necessary. It should show a clear view of progress without creating any extra work for the team.

## **Meeting the Digital Service Standard**

To pass [point 4 (use agile methods)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-4) in your [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment), you must show that your project has appropriate governance in place.

This includes:

* setting clear and measurable goals

* communicating progress regularly and clearly

* being able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances

## **Measuring and reporting progress in agile**

Measuring and reporting progress are built into agile ways of working so service teams will continuously produce the data you need. This includes:

* continuous planning - setting a vision, goals and objectives, developing a roadmap and tracking progress against them

* visual management - team walls and a backlog open to everyone

* face to face meetings - standup, show and tell, retrospectives for the team and the rest of the organisation

If you think you need extra reporting, make sure it’s really necessary and adds value. Too many reporting requirements become counterproductive as the team has less time to spend on delivery work. This is especially important for you to transition from one phase to another without the team losing momentum.

## **Reporting when you have more than one team**

If you’re working with more than one team on a service, having some consistency in how they report means you can more effectively:

* see progress

* support service teams

* make informed decisions

* communicate with the rest of your organisation (and the public) about the service

Don’t try to force more consistency than is practical because the circumstances of each team will be different.

# **Spend controls: check if you need approval to spend money on a service**

If you want to spend money on a digital or technology service, you may have to get approval from the Government Digital Service (GDS).

This process is known as ‘spend controls’.

## **Why some services must get spend approval**

GDS requires services to get spending approval to make sure they’re built in line with the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice).

You should read the code before starting work on your service and use it when making decisions about technology.

The spend controls process exists to make sure:

* you’ve considered the needs of the people who’ll use the service

* you get the best value

* you only spend on programmes and projects that meet government digital and technology strategies

* private businesses and members of the public can see how government makes decisions about spending money on digital projects or technology

* you discover and solve any problems with your service before you spend money

* you develop services using [agile methods](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)

## **How GDS decides which services need approval**

GDS decides whether your service needs approval based on these 3 factors:

* whether your department is a central government department - [download the public sector classification guide](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/datasets/publicsectorclassificationguide) to find out

* whether GDS classes your service as a digital service or a technology service

* the amount of money you want to spend

## **When your service is considered a digital service**

GDS considers your service a digital service if it’s online and it’ll be used by people who aren’t part of government, for example:

* citizens

* businesses

* other non-government organisations

The following are examples of digital services:

* transactional services (a service where the user gives personal details to government, eg applying for a passport)

* information services (a service where the user doesn’t have to give personal details, eg a tax or benefit calculator)

* web applications

* mobile apps

* websites

* extranets

GDS doesn’t consider your service a digital service if you’re creating content (and not a service) on:

* existing sites

* intranets

* areas listed under the [advertising, marketing and communications controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls)(see Annex 3)

## **When you need approval for digital services**

You must get approval to spend any amount of money on a new digital service that meets one or more of these conditions:

* it’s for the general public

* it uses [identity assurance](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/23/what-is-identity-assurance/)

* it requires domain registration

* it uses external-facing digital transactions

* it features website or mobile apps

For any other digital service, you must get approval to spend more than £100,000.

## **When your service is considered a technology service**

GDS considers your service a technology service if it meets all of these conditions:

* it’s internal facing

* it’s delivered by government for government

## **When you need approval for technology**

### **For technology that costs more than £1 million**

You must get approval to spend more than £1 million on any technology which is also delivered by Independent Shared Service Centres (ISSC), including:

* enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems

* human resource systems

* finance or accounting systems

* procurement systems

### **For technology that costs more than £5 million**

You must get approval to spend more than £5 million on technology, including any spending that’s related to the Public Services Network (PSN).

‘Technology’ means all parts of the service you’re proposing to build, including the following types of support:

* contacts in hosting

* data centres

* voice and video

* security

* third party support

## **Technology spending that counts as part of your total spend**

If GDS has classed your project as a technology project, any money you spend on the following counts as part of the total spend figure you must use when checking if you need spend approval:

* contract amendments, extensions or renewals

* licences

* spending through existing frameworks, eg cloud or commercial

* feasibility or proof of concept studies

* pilots

* projects (or any part of a project) and programmes - [find out the difference between projects and programmes](https://blog.apmg-international.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-project-and-a-program/)

* any changes, enhancements, maintenance or refreshes

* common infrastructure solutions including voice and data communications

* [PSN](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/public-services-network), whether fixed or mobile

* programmes that you’ve broken into smaller projects which individually are below the thresholds, but which are above them in total

### **Assisted digital spending that counts as part of your total spend**

You should consider the following types of [assisted digital support](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/assisted-digital-support-introduction) as part of your spend:

* face-to-face support

* phone support, eg call centres

* third party intermediary support, like service integrators, consultancies or partners

* other channels that allow users to access the digital service, eg letters

## **Projects that usually won’t be approved**

GDS usually won’t give you approval to spend money on the following activities:

* entering into an IT contract that’s worth more than £100 million

* contracting a company to supply you with system integration after you’ve already contracted them to provide you with a service in the same part of government - [find out why government has moved away from a towers model](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/18/knocking-down-the-towers-of-siam/)

* renewing contracts automatically

* offering new hosting contracts that last longer than 2 years

* building native or hybrid apps

If you want approval to spend money on one of these activities, contact GDSby emailing gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

# **Spend controls: apply for approval to spend money on a service**

Before you start building your service, you may need to apply to the Government Digital Service (GDS) for approval to spend money on it.

This process is known as ‘spend controls’.

Before you apply, [check if you need approval to spend money on your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/spending-money-on-your-service/check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service).

## **Why some services must get spend approval**

GDS requires services to get spending approval to make sure they’re built in line with the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice).

You should read the code before starting work on your service and use it when making decisions about technology.

The spend controls process exists to make sure:

* you’ve considered the needs of the people who’ll use the service

* you get the best value

* you only spend on programmes and projects that meet government digital and technology strategies

* members of the public or private businesses can see how government makes decisions about spending money on digital projects or technology

* you discover and solve any problems with your service before you spend money

* you develop services using [agile methods](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)

## **Before you apply**

Before you apply you must get your project signed off by either:

* your digital leader (if it’s a digital service) - [check if your service is a digital service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/spending-money-on-your-service/check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service#When-your-service-is-considered-a%20digital-service)

* your technology leader (if it’s a technology service) - [check if your service is a technology service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/spending-money-on-your-service/check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service#When-your-service-is-considered-a%20technology-service)

You must also contact GDS on gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk to discuss your idea

### **Major projects**

If your project costs more than your organisation’s expenditure limit, you need to [get assurance from the Major Projects Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/major-projects-authority).

## **When to apply**

If your service requires spend approval, you need to apply to GDS both:

* before your service goes into discovery phase

* before your service goes into live phase

## **How to apply**

### **Complete a spend control form**

To apply for approval, you must:

1. [Download a spend control form at Annex 5.1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls).

2. Complete the spend control form.

3. Send the completed form to gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

### **Share your business case**

If you haven’t shared your business case with GDS at the time you’re sending your spend control form, you must send either one of the following with the form:

* a programme business case, if you have one for your service and you’re using agile methods

* a traditional business case, if you’re using public sector OJEU (Official Journal of the European Union) procurement processes

Your spend control form will explain the detail your business case needs to include.
